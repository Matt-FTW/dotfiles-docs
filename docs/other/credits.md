# :tada: Credits

Big thanks to everyone at r/unixporn for inspiring me to make this!

I wanna point out some resources that helped me the most with the setup:

- [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) for all the awesome documentation and for helping me to not lose my mind.
- [Folke](https://github.com/folke) for his amazing contributions to the Neovim community with some awesome plugins and with the distro that i use: **LazyVim**. Also, his READMEs and [dotfiles](https://github.com/folke/dot) are amazing!
- [Yoru's README](https://github.com/rxyhn/yoru/tree/main) to help me with the distribution of the README.
- [Amadeus Dots](https://github.com/AmadeusWM/dotfiles-hyprland) for helping me with the startup setup of the Hyprland WM.
- [Hyprdots](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots) for helping me to take ideas from their work. Also, their setup is the best one I've ever seen for Hyprland; it's pretty awesome!.
- [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) for making the **Best Colorscheme Ever** üñåÔ∏è
- [Github-issue-templates](https://github.com/stevemao/github-issue-templates) for the some of the markdown templates of the repo.
- [Shina-Fox](https://github.com/Shina-SG/Shina-Fox) for the incredible userChrome.
- [Catppuccin-Startpage](https://github.com/pivoshenko/catppuccin-startpage) an asthetic and clean startpage for the browser.

Those were the biggest inspiring factor for me, though you can find a lot more of setups that helped me in my list of favorite dotfiles from the **Stars** section of my Github Profile: [Check it out!](https://github.com/stars/Matt-FTW/lists/paintbrush-theming-dots)
