## ❓ Does your dotfiles have an automatic installation? If not, are you planning on doing it?

No, I dont have any and im not planning on doing it. The main reason is the hasle that is to maintain an install script.

The automatic scripts are also "mainly" used without even checking on the code itself, which I think is pretty risky and should be avoided.

I feel like that way you dont also learn how to install the config which in some cases leds to not understanding what you're doing.

Sorry about it!

Even then, the installation steps are pretty easy and straightforward so everybody should be able to do follow them. If not, then that is a mistake on my part :)

## ❓ Are you planning on documenting the keybindings?

Nop. I dont feel it is neccesary because at some applications they can be seen on the help menu or just by looking at the config file.

Maybe at some point I'll update my [keyb config](https://github.com/Matt-FTW/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/keyb) so that the important bindings will be available there.

## ❓ Are custom themes something you'd introduce in the future?

Maybe. At least for me, I'm not going to use them. I like to stick to one theme only; in this case Catppuccin Macchiato.

But I understand that a lot of people like it, so if I have the time and the effort I'll do it; but it will take a lot of time to implement tho ;)
